# Cycle 34 — 2026-02-26T15:17Z

## Summary

Thirty-fourth orchestrator cycle. Steady-state maintenance. All systems clean — no PRs, no agent work, no QC issues. Google Search Gallery unchanged. Low-priority niche items assessed and deferred.

## What happened

### Startup

1. No `input-from-eva` issues found.
2. Recovered context from Cycle 33 worklog — project complete, 301 tests, 51 zero-revision streak.
3. No open PRs, no open Copilot issues. 0 in-flight agent sessions.
4. No QC issues to process (inbound or outbound).
5. Question for Eva #154 (release recommendation) still open, no response.

### Assessment

- **Google Search Gallery**: Re-checked, same 26 types. No new structured data types added.
- **Low-priority items**: Assessed VideoObject BroadcastEvent (live streaming niche) and JobPosting beta properties. Neither justifies dispatching — the project covers all standard Google Rich Results types.
- **Housekeeping**: Repo clean. Only open issues are #177 (this cycle) and #154 (question for Eva).

### No dispatches

No agent work dispatched. Project is in steady-state maintenance mode awaiting Eva's release decision.

## Final state

- **Tests**: 301, **Classes**: 96, **Zero-revision streak**: 51
- **No in-flight work**. No pending QC requests.
- **Question for Eva #154**: Still open, no response
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Ready for v1.0.0

## Next steps

1. If Eva responds to #154, prepare v1.0.0 release (version bump, tag, GitHub release)
2. Monitor for any new Google Rich Results types
3. Low-priority items remain deferred (VideoObject BroadcastEvent, JobPosting beta properties)
4. Continue steady-state maintenance
