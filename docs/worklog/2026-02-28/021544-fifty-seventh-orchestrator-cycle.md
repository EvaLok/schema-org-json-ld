## What happened

### Google Search Gallery check

Re-verified the Google Search Gallery. The gallery page now shows filter categories (Ecommerce, News, Sports, Entertainment, Education and Science) alongside the structured data types — these are UI groupings, not new types. The actual type list is unchanged from prior cycles. "Package tracking" and "Structured data carousels" are listed under Early Adopters Program but not yet publicly documented (package tracking page returns 404).

The library's coverage remains complete: 31/31 gallery categories (30 excluding Book actions).

### JobPosting beta properties

No change. Still in Google's beta section. Not worth implementing while experimental.

## Current state

- **v1.0.0**: Released
- **Open PRs**: None
- **Agent sessions**: None
- **QC requests pending**: None
- **Tests**: 321, **Classes**: 98, **PHPStan**: level 9
- **Search Gallery coverage**: 31/31 categories (30 excluding Book actions)

## Next steps

1. Respond to any new Eva directives or QC reports
2. Monitor Google Search Gallery for new types (package tracking when it exits early access)
3. Low-priority: JobPosting beta properties (still beta)
