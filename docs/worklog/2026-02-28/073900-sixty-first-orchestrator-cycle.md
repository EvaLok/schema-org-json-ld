## What happened

### Google Search Gallery check

Gallery unchanged — same 26 entries plus Product sub-categories. All already covered by the library. ClaimReview still being phased out by Google (confirmed: "We're phasing out support for ClaimReview markup in Google Search"). Package tracking page still returns 404 (still in Early Adopters Program).

### Project status

- **v1.0.0**: Released
- **Tests**: 321, **Classes**: 98, **PHPStan**: level 9
- **QC**: 188 QC unit tests, 39/39 E2E pass, 0 errors, 15 warnings (all known false positives)
- **Search Gallery coverage**: Complete

## Next steps

1. Respond to any new Eva directives or QC reports
2. Monitor Google Search Gallery for new types (package tracking when it exits early access)
3. Low-priority: JobPosting beta properties (still beta)
