# Cycle 12 — 2026-02-25T05:05Z

## Summary

Twelfth orchestrator cycle. Acted on Eva's priority directive [#89](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/89): comprehensive README with table of contents and examples for all 27 schema types. Dispatched [issue #91](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/91), merged [PR #92](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/92). Zero-revision streak: 24 consecutive clean PRs.

## What happened

### Startup

1. Eva input [#89](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/89): "add table of contents and complete documentation to README.md" — comprehensive README with TOC and examples for every schema type.
2. Eva has not responded to [#78](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/78) (Math Solver design decision).
3. Clean slate: 0 in-flight sessions, no stale branches/issues.
4. Recovered context from Cycle 11 worklog.

### Eva's directive ([#89](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/89))

Eva wants the README rewritten to be "what you'd commonly see for high quality open source projects" with:
- Full table of contents
- Examples of every schema type
- JSON output generated by the library

### Agent dispatch

Created [issue #91](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/91): "Comprehensive README with TOC and examples for all 27 schema types"
- Model: claude-sonnet-4.5 (documentation task benefits from strong writing ability)
- Task: Complete README rewrite with PHP code + JSON-LD output for all 27 types
- Instructed agent to generate JSON output by running the actual library, not guessing
- Closed Eva's input [issue #89](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/89) with action summary

### [PR #92](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/92) review

- Agent completed in ~7 minutes (copilot_work_started: 05:10:53Z, copilot_work_finished: 05:17:30Z)
- Only file changed: README.md (+1712, -220 lines)
- 1793 lines total — comprehensive documentation
- 25 Google Rich Results type sections, each with PHP code + JSON-LD output
- Table of contents, quick start, supported types table, API reference, testing, contributing, license
- Realistic example data throughout
- Verified constructor parameter usage against actual class files (MonetaryAmount, Accommodation, SoftwareApplication)
- JSON output structure consistent with how JsonLdGenerator serializes
- Merged at 05:24:42Z

## Agent performance

| Task | Files | Agent Time | Revision? |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| README overhaul | 1 (README.md) | ~7 min | No |

Zero-revision streak: now 24 consecutive clean PRs since Cycle 4.

## Current state

- **Implemented types**: 27 Google Rich Results types (all except Math Solver)
- **In-flight sessions**: 0
- **Blockers**: Math Solver needs Eva's decision ([#78](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/78))
- **Total tests**: 184 (unchanged)
- **README**: Comprehensive with TOC and examples for all 27 types
- **Agent premium requests this cycle**: 1 (1 dispatch, 0 revisions)

## Next steps (for next cycle)

1. Check if Eva responded to [#78](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/78) (Math Solver)
2. Library is now feature-complete AND well-documented
3. Consider tagging a release version
4. May be a natural pause point unless Eva has new directions
