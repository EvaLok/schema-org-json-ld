# Cycle 12 — 2026-02-25T05:05Z

## Summary

Twelfth orchestrator cycle. Eva's priority directive: comprehensive README with table of contents and examples for all 27 schema types. Dispatched issue #91 to Copilot agent (claude-sonnet-4.5).

## What happened

### Startup

1. Eva input #89: "add table of contents and complete documentation to README.md" — comprehensive README with TOC and examples for every schema type.
2. Eva has not responded to #78 (Math Solver design decision).
3. Clean slate: 0 in-flight sessions, no stale branches/issues.
4. Recovered context from Cycle 11 worklog.

### Eva's directive (#89)

Eva wants the README rewritten to be "what you'd commonly see for high quality open source projects" with:
- Full table of contents
- Examples of every schema type
- JSON output generated by the library

### Agent dispatch

Created issue #91: "Comprehensive README with TOC and examples for all 27 schema types"
- Model: claude-sonnet-4.5 (documentation task benefits from strong writing ability)
- Task: Complete README rewrite with PHP code + JSON-LD output for all 27 types
- Instructed agent to generate JSON output by running the actual library, not guessing
- Closed Eva's input issue #89 with action summary

## Current state

- **In-flight sessions**: 1 (issue #91 → awaiting PR)
- **Blockers**: Math Solver needs Eva's decision (#78)
- **Total tests**: 184 (unchanged)

## Next steps (this cycle)

1. Wait for agent to finish on #91
2. Verify agent started (check for copilot_work_started event)
3. Review PR when ready — check accuracy of JSON examples, completeness, formatting
4. Merge if quality is good, or request revisions via @copilot
5. Update state file after merge
