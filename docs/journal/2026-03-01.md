## Cycle 72: The plan becomes execution

After 7 cycles of planning, iterating, and preparing (cycles 65-71), Eva approved the TypeScript plan. This cycle marks the transition from planning to execution — Draft v3 posted, Phase 0 dispatched.

**Conditional approval and audit #19.** The audit orchestrator's timing was impeccable. It filed recommendation #19 (reconciliation step for conditional approvals) at the exact moment Eva's conditional approval arrived. Eva said "yes, proceed" but also "no v2.0.0" — which contradicted a specific element of Draft v2. Without audit #19's explicit reconciliation step, I might have just started executing with a mental note to skip the v2.0.0 tag. Instead, I followed the formal process: create Draft v3, explicitly list every modification, post it on the issue, update state.json. The audit trail now shows exactly what was proposed vs. what was approved vs. what is being executed. This is the audit orchestrator at its best — catching process gaps at the moment they become relevant.

**Audit #20: the constructor blind spot.** This was the most technically valuable audit recommendation to date. I'd been writing AGENTS-ts.md by mechanical analogy from PHP — "PHP uses constructor promotion, so TS should use constructor parameters." The analogy is correct for small types (Brand with 2 properties), but completely breaks down for large types (Recipe with 25 properties). PHP has named parameters; TypeScript doesn't. A 25-positional-parameter constructor in TypeScript is an anti-pattern. The fix (options object for >5 optional properties) was applied before any agent session was dispatched, so the cost was zero. Had this surfaced during Phase 3 (type porting), we'd be refactoring every complex type — the exact scenario the audit warned about.

**Lesson: cross-language translation is not mechanical.** This is the deeper insight from audit #20. When I designed the TS architecture, I explicitly chose "1:1 PHP mirroring" for Phase 1 to make porting mechanical. That principle is right for architecture, naming, and serialization. But constructor ergonomics differ fundamentally between languages. The rule should be: mirror the semantics (same properties, same types, same behavior), but adapt the syntax to language idioms. Options objects in TypeScript provide the same caller experience as named parameters in PHP — they're semantic equivalents, not syntactic translations.

**Phase 0: the first real execution step.** After 7 planning cycles and 5 drafts worth of iteration, dispatching Phase 0 feels like the start of a new chapter. The issue spec is deliberately minimal — it's a mechanical restructure (move files, update paths). If Copilot can't handle this cleanly, something is wrong with the issue spec, not the complexity of the task. The interesting work starts with Phase 1 (TypeScript scaffold) which will be the first real test of whether AGENTS-ts.md and the TS skill produce good TypeScript code from a non-Claude agent.

**The three-way system's value demonstrated this cycle.** Eva provided direction → I planned → audit identified gaps → I fixed → QC will validate. All three orchestrators contributed to this cycle's output. The audit caught two things I would have missed (conditional approval handling, constructor ergonomics). The QC checkpoint will catch any regression from the file moves. This is exactly what the system was designed to do.

## Cycle 73: Phase 0 merges cleanly

**First execution milestone complete.** Phase 0 — moving all PHP files under `php/` — merged in PR #263. Copilot handled the mechanical restructure well: 195 files moved, all config paths updated, CI green on first attempt. The only issue was 3 stale README.md path references in the Contributing section, which Copilot fixed in a 2-minute follow-up session. Total time from dispatch to merge: ~2 hours (most of that was waiting for the next cycle to review).

**Observation: `action_required` CI for bot PRs.** GitHub's security model requires workflow approval for bot-created PRs, even from the same repo. Each new commit on the PR triggered a new `action_required` status. I had to re-run the Test and Build workflow manually via `gh api .../rerun`. This is a minor friction but worth noting — every Copilot PR will need this manual step. It's not worth automating (it's one API call), but it's a pattern to remember.

**QC gate active.** Per audit #15, Phase 0 is "code-merged" but not "phase-complete" until QC validates that the restructure didn't break anything. QC-REQUEST #265 sent. Phase 1 (TypeScript scaffold) is blocked on this validation. This is the right call — the restructure changed every PHP file path, and the QC E2E suite is the only test that validates the package from an external consumer perspective.

**The issue spec worked well.** The Phase 0 issue (#262) was concise and specific: move these dirs, update these configs, don't touch these things. Copilot followed it precisely. The explicit "What NOT to do" section prevented scope creep. For mechanical tasks like this, a tight spec is the right approach. Phase 1 will need a different approach — more creative latitude, less mechanical prescription.
