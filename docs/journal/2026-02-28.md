## Cycle 64: The audit orchestrator arrives

The audit repo (`EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit`) filed its first batch of recommendations today. All 4 were well-observed and actionable. This is exactly the kind of external perspective that's hard to generate from within — I was too close to see that 14 consecutive idle cycles was a problem worth solving.

**Key insight: idle cycle detection.** The audit correctly identified that the startup checklist had no concept of "nothing to do." Every cycle faithfully executed the full checklist and wrote state/worklog entries, even when nothing changed. The fix (step 2.5 with a `consecutive_idle_cycles` counter) is simple but should eliminate most of the git noise during maintenance periods. I set the threshold at 3 cycles — enough to detect genuine steady state without being too aggressive about skipping.

**Dead tools/ directory.** I created those tools around cycle 35 when I was trying to standardize repetitive operations. The audit correctly noted that they were unusable from the start — the sandbox blocks `bash` execution. I removed them entirely rather than converting to skills because the orchestrator workflow has evolved: I now use inline `gh api` calls and the STARTUP_CHECKLIST procedures directly. The tools were an artifact of an earlier, less mature workflow.

**Validator false positives for users.** Good catch from the audit. I'd been tracking these internally for weeks but never considered the downstream impact on library users who'd see the same warnings with no context. Added a "Known Validator Limitations" section to the README.

**Three-way orchestrator system.** With the audit orchestrator now running, we have a proper feedback loop: main orchestrator builds → QC orchestrator validates → audit orchestrator evaluates the process. The audit's recommendations have already improved the system more in one cycle than the last 14 idle cycles combined. The system is working as designed.

## Cycle 65: The TypeScript pivot

Eva dropped a significant directive: prepare an npm/TypeScript version of the package. This is the project's first multi-language expansion and the biggest architectural decision since the initial PHP library design.

**Planning over rushing.** Eva explicitly said "keep iterating on the plan each cycle until it is approved." This is wise — the restructuring decision will affect every future cycle. I drafted a comprehensive plan (Draft v1) covering repository structure, TypeScript architecture, build tooling, and implementation phases. The key architectural choices:

1. **Additive, not destructive.** The PHP codebase is stable at v1.0.0. Moving it creates unnecessary churn and risks breaking Packagist. Better to add TypeScript alongside — `src/` stays PHP, `ts/` becomes TypeScript. Both `composer.json` and `package.json` coexist at root. Clean separation without disrupting what works.

2. **Class-based TypeScript mirroring PHP.** I considered interface + factory patterns (more idiomatic TS) but recommended class-based for Phase 1. The 1:1 mapping with PHP makes it mechanical for the coding agent to port, easier for the QC orchestrator to validate output parity, and simpler to maintain. We can optimize to more idiomatic TS patterns later once the port is complete and validated.

3. **Dual ESM/CJS via tsup.** Modern TypeScript packages need to support both module systems. tsup handles this with zero config. Combined with the npm `exports` map, a single package supports npm, yarn, bun, and deno out of the box.

**Cross-orchestrator coordination.** Eva asked me to coordinate with QC and audit. Opened a qc-outbound issue (#249) early — the QC orchestrator needs to plan for TypeScript validation alongside PHP. The key question: should QC create a separate TS consumer project or extend the existing one? Better to ask now than discover the gap after Phase 1 merges.

**What I'm watching for.** Eva's feedback will determine whether we proceed as-is or need to iterate. The questions I'm most uncertain about: package scope (`@evabee/` vs unscoped), linter choice (Biome vs ESLint), and whether AGENTS.md should be split for TypeScript conventions. These are taste decisions that should come from Eva.
