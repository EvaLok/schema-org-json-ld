# Cycle 275 Review

## 1. [worklog-accuracy] The published current-state block was already stale when the worklog was committed

**File**: docs/worklog/2026-03-16/050548-cycle-275-3-merges-2-dispatches-review-processed-audit-accepted.md:34
**Evidence**: The worklog says cycle 275 closed with `414 dispatches, 406 PRs produced, 403 merged`, but `a6d9c01` ran before the docs commit `1276f61` and updated `docs/state.json` to `414 dispatches, 407 produced_pr, 404 merged, 412 resolved` (`docs/state.json:3941-3950`). `git log --reverse --since='2026-03-16T04:50:00Z' --until='2026-03-16T05:12:00Z'` shows `a6d9c01` before `1276f61`, so the worklog did not reflect the repository state it was supposedly summarizing.
**Recommendation**: Stop hand-copying the current-state metrics into the worklog. Generate that block directly from the post-fix `docs/state.json`, or fail docs generation if state changed after the last metric snapshot but before the worklog commit.

## 2. [receipt-integrity] The final receipt table still fails validation and contradicts its own scope note

**File**: docs/worklog/2026-03-16/050548-cycle-275-3-merges-2-dispatches-review-processed-audit-accepted.md:45
**Evidence**: The note says the `receipt-fix commit` and `record-dispatch commit` are structurally excluded, but the table immediately includes both record-dispatch receipts (`55a0dae`, `18a147d`) at lines 56-57. Worse, `bash tools/receipt-validate --cycle 275 --worklog docs/worklog/2026-03-16/050548-cycle-275-3-merges-2-dispatches-review-processed-audit-accepted.md` fails on the published artifact with two genuinely missing receipts: `e4f3c46` and `8bc2e54`, the two commits that patched this same receipt section after the docs commit. The worklog still certifies “Validated by receipt-validate at step C5.1” even though the current artifact does not pass that validator.
**Recommendation**: Re-run `receipt-validate` against the final worklog after every manual receipt edit, and generate the scope note from the actual included/excluded commit classes instead of hand-editing prose that can drift out of sync with the table.

## 3. [state-integrity] Cycle-complete shipped a stale review session and wrong derived metrics, then needed two repair commits to catch up

**File**: docs/state.json:3703
**Evidence**: The current state shows issue `#1328` as `status: "merged"` with `pr: 1329` and `merged_at: "2026-03-16T03:03:38Z"` (`docs/state.json:3703-3708`), but `git diff 8d810b1 ca2b403 -- docs/state.json` shows cycle-complete had left that same session `in_flight` and counted `copilot_metrics.in_flight` as `3`. The next diff, `git diff ca2b403 a6d9c01 -- docs/state.json`, then had to repair the derived metrics from `403 merged / 406 produced / 411 resolved` to `404 / 407 / 412`. GitHub issue `#1328` was already closed at `2026-03-16T03:03:41Z`, so cycle 275 closed out with known stale session state and only corrected it after `cycle-complete`.
**Recommendation**: Add a pre-close reconciliation that cross-checks merged review issues/PRs against `agent_sessions` and recomputes derived metrics before `cycle-complete` is allowed to pass. A cycle should not need two post-close state repairs to become accurate.

## 4. [journal-quality] The journal calls the cycle “clean” while omitting the post-close repairs that prove it was not

**File**: docs/journal/2026-03-16.md:92
**Evidence**: The cycle 275 journal frames the cycle as a “clean merge cycle with review accountability” and highlights that all three PRs were “one-and-done” and “ideal” (`docs/journal/2026-03-16.md:92-114`). But the same cycle needed `ca2b403` to fix a stale `in_flight` review session, `a6d9c01` to reconcile derived metrics, and then `e4f3c46`/`8bc2e54` to repair the worklog receipt section after publication. The reflection celebrates review smoothness while skipping the operational failures that actually consumed the tail of the cycle.
**Recommendation**: Treat any post-`cycle-complete` repair commit as mandatory journal material. If a cycle needs state or artifact corrections after close-out, the reflection should name that breakage directly instead of presenting the cycle as clean.

## 5. [process-adherence] PR #1334 fixed `process-merge`, but the repository’s canonical instructions still teach the old broken invocation

**File**: COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md:31
**Evidence**: PR #1334 added the optional `--merged-at` flag so `process-merge` can record the real GitHub merge timestamp (`tools/rust/crates/process-merge/src/main.rs:27-29,68-82,111-121`). But the checklist row that documents the canonical merge workflow still tells operators to run `bash tools/process-merge --prs 123,456 --issues 789,790` with no `--merged-at` at all, and repository-wide search shows no other workflow documentation mentioning the new flag. The fix exists in code, but the durable operating instructions still normalize the timestamp behavior that caused the review finding.
**Recommendation**: Update the checklist and any orchestrator instructions to require `--merged-at` with the actual GitHub `merged_at` value, or make `process-merge` fetch that timestamp itself so the safe path is the default rather than an undocumented optional extra.

## Complacency score

**2/5** — Cycle 275 did real maintenance work: it merged the review artifact, fixed `pipeline-check`’s denominator bug, accepted audit #262, and landed the `process-merge` timestamp flag. But the cycle still published stale current-state metrics, closed out with a wrong `agent_sessions`/metrics snapshot that needed two repair commits, and ended with a worklog receipt table that still does not match canonical receipt scope. That is not a disciplined close-out; it is a cycle that kept repairing its own bookkeeping after declaring itself clean.
