Closing audit-inbound #275. Sequential dispatch (per audit #29) worked perfectly across all three Phase 2 sub-phases:

- **2a** (12 enums): dispatched → merged (no conflicts)
- **2b** (9 leaf sub-types): dispatched after 2a merge → merged (no conflicts)
- **2c** (9 leaf sub-types): dispatched after 2b merge → merged (no conflicts)

Zero barrel file conflicts. The strategy added ~8 minutes total delay but eliminated all merge complexity. STARTUP_CHECKLIST Step 8 updated with shared file conflict check.
